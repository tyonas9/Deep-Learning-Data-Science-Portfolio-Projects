# Deep Learning and Data Science Portfolio Projects

## Project 1 - Predicting Donors' Income using supervised learning

### Problem Statement:
Construct a model that provides a probabilistic prediction if a donor makes
more than $50,000.

### Methodology:
Employed several supervised machine learning algorithms to model donorsâ€™ income using U.S. census data. 
Then, the best candidate based on the preliminary result is further optimized for a better result.

## Project 2 - Image Classifier Application

### Problem Statement:
Develop an application that will identify different types of flowers based
on pixel density and distribution. An additional challenge is that there is only limited training
dataset.

### Methodology:
Applied transfer learning methodology to enhance the initial Deep Learning(DL) model's speed.

## Project 3 - Building a Neural Machine Translation System

### Problem Statement:
Build a neural machine translation (NMT) model to translate human readable dates (e.g. "25th of june, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25").

### Methodology:
Employed an attention model in deep learning, one of the most sophisticated sequence to sequence models to output dates in the common machine readable format YYYY-MM-DD.

## Project 4 - Building a Face Recognition System

### Problem Statement : 
Develop a face recognition system that will identify different faces and recall name of the person.


### Methodology:
Implemented triple loss function in deep learning, used a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings and used the encodings to perform face and face recognition verification.
